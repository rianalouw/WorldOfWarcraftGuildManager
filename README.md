## World of Warcraft Guild Manager ##

The world of gaming has changed drastically since the first version of naughts and crosses came out in 1952. Today computer gaming can be a highly profitable 
hobby if you are able to play extremely well. Additionally it also depends on what game you are playing in order to win different amount of prize moneys. A good 
example would be the DOTA tournament of 2014 where the winning team of 6 players won a total of R 59 963 124,18. In a different game World Of Warcraft users can 
partake in various activities and have guilds. Guilds are groups of people who act together to achieve a particular goal. Managing these individuals can be a 
tedios job. Various guild members can have various interests and personalities can often clash. Thus I believe that a tool that allows the guild master (the 
guild owner) to manage his/her guild members could be beneficial. 

###What is the World of Warcraft Guild Manager###
The World of Warcraft Guild Manager is a prototype tool meant to explore the posibility of organising guild members in the most efficient manner. Using this 
tool a guild master can add his/her guild members to a dynamic list and categorize them according to their interests. The guild master can also plan events 
and keep track of them.

The main entities of the project composes of users (the players of the game) and characters (the creatures created by the users to explore and partake in 
activities within the game). A single user may own multiple characters. The guild master is also considered a user. All the users belong to the guild. Thus 
the guild is composed of one or more users. 

Furthermore each character consists of a race, class (type of magic the character is able to use), and a role (type of duty the character performs).

The guild itself has a compulsory faction and realm.

The guild can have multiple events. And each event requires a particular location. 

###Obstacles###
World Of Warcraft was first released in 1994 and is thus a highly developed and complex game. The complexity of the game may force multiple modifications as the 
prototype advances into later development stages. Additionally the success of the program depends on accurate data that needs to be captured by the guild 
master. Thus the existing ERD may have to be altered in the future.
